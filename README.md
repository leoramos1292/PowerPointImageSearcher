# Power Point Image Searcher

Hello! Thank you for checking out this project! This porgram helps you in creating a PowerPoint slide with a title, a body and images.

The first page has two input boxes called Title and Text along with a submit button. After you type words into the input boxes and click the submit button the program will use all the words in the title input box and only the bold words in the text input box and do a google image search on them. 

You will then get to pick a few pictures to put into a PowerPoint slide. Once the pictures have been selected the program will generate a PowerPoint slide with your input from the Title and Text boxes and display the selected images.
